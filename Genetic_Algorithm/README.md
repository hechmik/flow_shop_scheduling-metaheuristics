For implementing a custom version of Genetic Algorithm I used many support functions that are called in *ga_jobs*.

These ones were developed and shared by [**Professor Michele Ciavotta**](https://www.unimib.it/michele-ciavotta) during the Decision Models course, part of the [**M.Sc. Data Science program**](http://datascience.disco.unimib.it/en/) at **University of Milan-Bicocca** in which I am currently enrolled.
