In this algorithm you can find two R scripts that implements the Particle Swarm Optimitazione algorithm described in this [README.md](https://github.com/hechmik/flowshopscheduling/blob/master/README.md) file

The only difference between the two is that *PSO_early_stop.R*[PSO_early_stop.R] accepts a parameters that will allow to early stop the algorithm procedure if for a given number of iterations the global best value is not improved.
